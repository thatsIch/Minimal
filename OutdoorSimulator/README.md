# Outdoor Simulator

The Outdoor Simulator changes time-based wallpapers according to the current location of the user.

## How it works

The user enters his geographical coordinates which are translated into the current time layout of the day.
The layout consist of markers which represent sunset, dawn etc.
This way we know how long the day/night is and can slice them accordingly into multiple fragments.
These fragments are represented by different wallpapers where the sun or the stars are "moving".

# Minimal

Minimal is a Rainmeter Skin, which can be found [here](http://rainmeter.net/cms/). It offers minimalistic tools for your desktop work and fun, for example Media Player, FeedReader and display of statistics of your CPU, RAM, Volume, etc

It requires the most current version of Rainmeter to work. 

## Features

### Media Player

It is designed after [EdgePlayer 3.0](http://codymacri.deviantart.com/art/Edge-Player-3-0-363324372?ga_submit_new=10%253A1365016951) but offers additional features and removes in my opinion unneeded meters which are often not provided.

* MouseHover of the Controls (Displays another in another color if you mouseover the icons)
* LeftClick anywhere on the bar and drag'n'drop however you like to set the media player to a specific position of your song
* Smart Aligner - perfectly divides the bar into 100 parts
* RightClick and drag'n'drop to set the volume to a specified volume
* Low Profile Update - Updates and renders only necessary updates
* Hides if Player is inactive (EdgePlayer 3.0) and shows if Player is active again
* Fits each WorkArea automatically since it works with #SCREENAREAWIDTH#

### Notes

Revolutionary Note-Design which involves seperate NoteSkins which can be called smartly by detecting the `Active` State in the `[Rainmeter]` Configuration file.

* Fast Edit - `Left-Click` to edit the file with Windows Notepad, press ESC to close the file (AutoIt Script)
* Fast response - updates immediatly upon load or change
* Low Profile Update - Updates only on Change or on Load
* Easy Disposal - `Right-Click` to close the skin, but content stays saved
* Positioning - you can place each element whereever you like
* Expandable - Default are 5 notes, but you can easily expand this by copy & paste the Note1 files and rename them to NoteN where `N` is the next iteration in line. You can find it under `Minimal\Dock\Notes`. You will find 5 folders there to replicate. The script will automatically detect more notes if necessary

### System Stats

Easy Display of CPU, RAM and Download without the need for numbers. Minimum and Maximum are displayed through 2 seperate colors

* No Numbers
* No Cluttering
* One Icon displays all information
* if necessary `MouseOver` displays the current percentage as a tooltip

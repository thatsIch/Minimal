# Minimal

Minimal is a Rainmeter Skin, which can be found [here](http://rainmeter.net/cms/). It offers minimalistic tools for your desktop work and fun, for example Media Player, FeedReader and display of statistics of your CPU, RAM, Volume, etc

It requires the most current version of Rainmeter to work. 

## Features

### Media Player

It is designed after [EdgePlayer 3.0](http://codymacri.deviantart.com/art/Edge-Player-3-0-363324372?ga_submit_new=10%253A1365016951) but offers additional features and removes in my opinion unneeded meters which are often not provided
